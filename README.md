# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to provide insights into case counts, fatalities, and recovery rates across various regions. The analysis explores data trends and visualizes COVID-19's impact globally, aiding in understanding pandemic trends over time.

## Dataset

The analysis uses a dataset named `covid_19_data.csv`, which includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide, broken down by date and region. Key fields in this dataset include:
- `Date`: The date of data recording
- `Country/Region`: The country or region of reported data
- `Confirmed`: Total confirmed cases
- `Deaths`: Total deaths recorded
- `Recovered`: Total recovered cases

## Project Structure

The notebook is organized as follows:
1. **Data Loading**: Imports the dataset and inspects initial rows to understand its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualizes data trends for COVID-19 cases, fatalities, and recoveries.
    - Analyzes trends for specific countries or regions.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creates plots to show the spread and trends in COVID-19 cases and fatalities over time.

## Requirements

The project requires Python libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Usage

To replicate this analysis:
1. Load the notebook.
2. Ensure the `covid_19_data.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Results

This analysis provides visual insights into COVID-19 trends, which can be used to understand the pandemic's evolution across different regions.
